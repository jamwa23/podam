Issue at hand and my solution to the problem;
1) CircleCI is case-sensitive , so rename Circle.yml to circle.yml
2) You need to enable Maven Surefire Plugin in pov.xml file in root dir
just remove below code at line 279:

<configuration>
<skip>true</skip>
</configuration>


3) You need clear you circle.yml file and add below lines:

test:
post:
- mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/
- find . -type f -regex ".*/target/surefire-reports/.*xml" -exec cp {} $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/ \;
